# Git Rebase

When doing an interactive `git rebase`rebasing, `git` tells you that you can
`p`ick, `r`eword, `e`dit, `s`quash, `d`rop or `f`ixup changes.

With this package installed, just pressing the initial letter will switch the
verb on the current line to the indicated one, and place the cursor at the start
of the current line.
