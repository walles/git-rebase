# Git Rebase

When doing an interactive `git rebase`rebasing, `git` tells you that you can
`p`ick, `r`eword, `e`dit, `s`quash, `d`rop or `f`ixup changes.

With this package installed, just pressing the initial letter will switch the
command on the current line to the indicated one, and place the cursor at the
start of the current line.
